## project layout
the backend is the `crit_launcher/` package, one folder per feature. see [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for where everything lives and how to debug it.

run from source: `python crit.py` (needs `pywebview`)
tests: `python -m unittest discover -s tests`

## compilation
first install the source code (the `icon.ico` is already in the folder)
then run
```
pyinstaller --onefile --windowed --name crit --icon=icon.ico --add-data "index.html;." crit.py
```
setup:
[innosetup](https://jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php)
then run `packaging/windows/critsetup.iss`

linux: run `packaging/linux/build-appimage.sh` (see `packaging/linux/README.md`)
